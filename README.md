# Rock'n Roller

Item Scroller unofficial forge port.

</div></center>

Rock'n Roller is a Minecraft mod that adds various 
convenience features for moving items inside inventory GUIs. Examples are scrolling the mouse wheel over 
slots with items in them or Shift/Ctrl + click + dragging over slots to move items from them in various 
ways etc.

Item scrolling is basically what the old NEI mod did and Mouse Tweaks also does.
This mod has some different drag features compared to Mouse Tweaks, and also some special
villager trading related helper features as well as crafting helper features.
